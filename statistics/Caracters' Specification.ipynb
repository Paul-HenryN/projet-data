    "# Statistical Caracters\n",
    "    In order to be able to measure the efficiency or quality of our chosen algorithm to solve the VRP Problem, we will carry out a statistical descriptive\n",
    "    study of the solution we put in place. As such, it is necessary to first of all determine the caracters which will be used as a base for our statistical \n",
    "    measures as well as an upcoming statistical predictive study.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Number of vehicles\n",
    "    This caracter will permit us to compare the different solutions taking into account the varrying number of vehicles we set at the departure of the \n",
    "    algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Number of Iterations\n",
    "    This caracter will enable us to know the number of iterations which permitted our algorithm to find the optimal solution. As such, we will be able to \n",
    "    use it as unit of comparism in our sample.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Number of clients\n",
    "    The number of clients which is equally the number of vertices to cover in the sub-graph will change for each individual of the sample. As such, it can\n",
    "    be used to compare the efficiency of our algorithm.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Covered distance\n",
    "    Which is the sum of the weight of the path chosen by the algorithm in the subgraph.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Convergence Time\n",
    "    This is the time taken by our algorithm for each individual of our sample to find the optimal solution. We should note that it is one of the main\n",
    "    factors which will permit us to determine the efficiency of our solution.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Memory Storage\n",
    "    This is the amount of memory storage used by the algorithm in order to achieve its execution. It is a sum of the the different data types multiplied\n",
    "    by the number of elements using these data types. Note here that, it varries throughout the algorithm and may be increasing as well as reducing (such\n",
    "    as deleting an element or a variable from the data type.) "
