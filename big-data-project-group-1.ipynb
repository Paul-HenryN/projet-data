    "This project discusses about the global awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions since the 1990s. While some commitments have been made, many scientists consider them insufficient to slow down climate change. The focus is now on changing behaviors, with a shift towards a more circular economy, better transportation modes, and energy-efficient buildings. The ADEME has launched a call for interest to promote the implementation of new mobility solutions for people and goods adapted to different types of territories. The Ucac-Icam structure is already active in this domain and has conducted several studies on Intelligent Multimodal Mobility. The study in question is a response to the call of the ADEME and aims to address the major challenge of optimizing the management of resources in transportation logistics with significant environmental impact.\n",

The main difference is that in the TSP all cities need to be visited only once, whereas in our problem only a subset of cities needs to be connected. However, as in the TSP, our problem requires finding a path that allows us to return to the starting point.\n",

    "### <b>Algorithmic modeling</b>\n",
    "The methods for solving TSP can be classified into three categories: exact, heuristic, and metaheuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exact methods guarantee to find the optimal solution but are generally limited to relatively small instances. Exact methods include linear programming, dynamic programming, exhaustive search, and branch and cut.\n",
    "\n",
    "Heuristic methods do not guarantee to find the optimal solution but are often faster and can find reasonable quality solutions for larger instances. Heuristic methods include construction algorithms, local search algorithms, simulated annealing algorithms, and tabu search algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaheuristic methods are problem-solving algorithms that can be applied to a wide range of difficult problems, including TSP. Metaheuristic methods include genetic algorithms, ant colony algorithms, simulated annealing algorithms, tabu search algorithms, and swarm optimization algorithms.\n",
    "Here are some examples of algorithms for each category:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exact methods:** *Integer linear programming (ILP), branch and cut, branch and price, cutting planes, etc.*  \n",
    "**Heuristic methods:** *Nearest neighbor, furthest insertion, 2-opt, 3-opt, Lin-Kernighan, etc.*  \n",
    "**Metaheuristic methods:** *Genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing, tabu search, swarm optimization, etc.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison of TSP solving methods:\n",
    "Exact methods are the most precise but are often limited to relatively small instances due to the complexity of the problem. Heuristic methods are faster and can find reasonable quality solutions for larger instances, but they do not guarantee the quality of the solution. Metaheuristic methods are more robust and flexible algorithms that can be adapted to various problems and objectives. Metaheuristic methods can find reasonable quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time for larger instances, but there is no guarantee of finding the optimal solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, exact methods are recommended for relatively small instances and for problems where the quality of the solution is critical. Heuristic and metaheuristic methods are recommended for larger instances and for problems where computation time is critical. The selection of the method depends on the specific problem, objective, constraints, and available resources.\n",
    "The choice of TSP solving method depends on several criteria, such as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "__The size of the problem instance:__ Exact methods are more suitable for small instances, while heuristic and metaheuristic methods are more suitable for larger instances.\n",
    "The required solution quality: Exact methods guarantee the optimal solution, while heuristic and metaheuristic methods do not guarantee the quality of the solution but can provide a reasonable quality solution in a reasonable amount of time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "__The constraints of the problem:__ Some TSP problems may have specific constraints, such as time, capacity, or distance constraints. Some algorithms may be better suited for handling these constraints.  \n",
    "Available computing resources: Exact methods may require a lot of computation time and memory for larger instances, while heuristic and metaheuristic methods are generally faster and require fewer computing resources.  \n",
    "The complexity of the problem: Some TSP problems may be more complex than others in terms of graph topology or cost distribution. Some algorithms may be better suited for solving more complex problems.  \n",
    "The flexibility of the algorithm: Some TSP algorithms are more flexible and can be easily adapted to other combinatorial optimization problems.  \n",
    "In general, the choice of the TSP solving method should be based on a comprehensive evaluation of the above criteria. Exact methods can be used for small instances where the quality of the solution is critical, while heuristic and metaheuristic methods can be used for larger instances and where computation time is critical. TSP algorithms can also be combined to improve solution quality and reduce computation time.  \n",
    "Metaheuristic methods are often used to solve the TSP because the problem is known to be NP-hard, which means that it is computationally infeasible to find the exact optimal solution for large instances within a reasonable amount of time. Metaheuristic methods offer a way to find solutions that are close to the optimal solution in a reasonable amount of time, even for large instances.  \n",
    "Metaheuristic methods are problem-solving algorithms that can be applied to a wide range of difficult problems, including TSP. These methods are designed to explore the solution space efficiently and find good quality solutions without the need for complete knowledge of the problem. Metaheuristic methods are especially useful for TSP because they can handle the combinatorial explosion that arises from the large number of possible permutations of the cities in the TSP.  \n",
    "There are many different metaheuristic methods that can be used to solve the TSP, including genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, simulated annealing, tabu search, and swarm optimization. Each of these methods has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of method will depend on the specific requirements of the problem and the available resources.  \n",
    "In summary, we use metaheuristic methods to solve the TSP because they offer a way to find good quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time, even for large instances, when exact methods are computationally infeasible.\n",
    "Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are two metaheuristic algorithms that are frequently used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) due to their ability to find high-quality solutions in a reasonable amount of time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "ACO is inspired by the behavior of real ants, where a group of ants working together can find the shortest path between their nest and a food source. In ACO algorithms, artificial ants construct candidate solutions by traversing the graph, depositing pheromone on the edges they visit, and updating the pheromone trails based on the quality of the solutions found. The pheromone trails act as a communication mechanism between the ants and guide the search towards promising regions of the solution space. ACO algorithms have been shown to be effective in finding high-quality solutions for TSP instances of various sizes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "GA is inspired by the process of natural selection, where solutions are evolved through a process of selection, crossover, and mutation. In GA algorithms, a population of candidate solutions is evolved through generations, and the fittest solutions are selected for reproduction to produce the next generation. Crossover and mutation operators introduce diversity into the population and can help to avoid getting stuck in local optima. GA algorithms have been shown to be effective in finding high-quality solutions for TSP instances of various sizes.  \n",
    "Both ACO and GA algorithms have been extensively studied and have been shown to perform well on the TSP and other combinatorial optimization problems.  \n",

    "There are several methods for generating random graphs. Here are some of the most common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Erdős-Rényi model:__ This model is based on a fixed probability for each pair of nodes to have an edge between them. The graphs generated by this model have a Poisson degree distribution, which means that the number of nodes with a given degree follows a Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Barabási-Albert model:__ This model is based on the principle that new nodes connect to existing nodes with a probability proportional to their degree. The graphs generated by this model have a power law degree distribution, which means that there are a small number of nodes with a high degree and a large number of nodes with a low degree.\n",
    "Watts-Strogatz model: This model is based on creating a regular graph and randomly rewiring edges to create a more random graph. The graphs generated by this model have a degree distribution that has a bell shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Configuration model:__ This model is based on creating a graph by specifying the desired degree distribution of the nodes. The edges are then created in a way that respects these degrees. The graphs generated by this model have a specified degree distribution in advance.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Kleinberg's random graph model:__ This model is based on the idea that nodes are more likely to connect to nearby nodes, but there can be long-distance connections. The graphs generated by this model have a power law degree distribution and a small characteristic path length.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods for generating random graphs are widely used in computer science and mathematics research to study the properties of random graphs and their behavior in different situations. The *Erdős-Rényi model* is a popular method for producing random graphs because it is simple to implement and can generate graphs with a wide range of densities. The model is based on the idea of randomly adding edges to a set of n nodes, with each possible edge being included with a fixed probability p. The resulting graph is known as an *Erdős-Rényi random graph*, denoted by G(n,p).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Erdős-Rényi model has several advantages, including its simplicity, ease of implementation, and flexibility in generating graphs with a wide range of densities. It has been used in a variety of applications, including the study of random networks, the modeling of social networks, and the analysis of communication networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one limitation of the Erdős-Rényi model is that it assumes a uniform distribution of edges across all pairs of nodes, which may not reflect the structure of real-world networks. Additionally, the model does not take into account any underlying structure or clustering in the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, the Erdős-Rényi model remains a popular choice for generating random graphs and has been used extensively in the field of graph theory and network science.t contexts."
