    "This project discusses about the global awareness of the need to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions since the 1990s. While some commitments have been made, many scientists consider them insufficient to slow down climate change. The focus is now on changing behaviors, with a shift towards a more circular economy, better transportation modes, and energy-efficient buildings. The ADEME has launched a call for interest to promote the implementation of new mobility solutions for people and goods adapted to different types of territories. The Ucac-Icam structure is already active in this domain and has conducted several studies on Intelligent Multimodal Mobility. The study in question is a response to the call of the ADEME and aims to address the major challenge of optimizing the management of resources in transportation logistics with significant environmental impact.\n",

    "The aim of this project is to generate an optimal delivery tour using operational research techniques. We will need to calculate a tour that connects a set of cities, minimizing the distance traveled while respecting the problem's constraints.\n",
